# Linkdini-Comment-Bot
This project is a Python automation script using Selenium to auto-post comments on LinkedIn posts using your existing Chrome profile. It reads a list of posts and their corresponding comments from a CSV file and posts them one by one with a 1-minute delay between each to avoid spam detection.
